## Homework 8

For this homework you will be converting a string from upper case to lower case.
To do this, first you will need to create a local variable that contains a string.
That string will then be printed to the terminal in all upper case.

### Example Output

Let's say we have a string in our assembly code that contains the value "HELLO".
Upon running our code the terminal should output "hello".
Below is a example of how your code should work and look upon completion.

```
> make
> ./output_file
hello
```

### Grading

Partial credit will be given to not working code.
If there is no makefile or the makefile does not produce an output file you will get a 0.
